		<p>Why Empty Bliss <a href="http://www.homeoint.org/morrell/buddhism/bliss.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you ask?</a> As a <a href="https://www.ramameditationsociety.org/tantric-buddhism-rama">Tantric Buddhist Mystic</a>, I practice Knowing and remaining in Emptiness and Bliss. Please mind the word practice.</p>
<p>My greatest passion is collaborative human co-creation. Getting and staying in sync to create beauty effortlessly. I enjoy leading as much as following when others are leading. It is said the most important drum to bring to a drum circle is one's ear dum which I Know to be true and wise.</p>
<p>My highest value is Balance which allows me to remain in the Middle in Emptiness and Bliss. To this end I am preferring the idea of remote work as it allows me to control my set and setting to the betterment of the work outcomes.</p>
<p>When not coding, I love drumming (drum circles), dancing, and singing. I find these things to be Meditative for me. I also enjoy time with my partner and children.</p>
